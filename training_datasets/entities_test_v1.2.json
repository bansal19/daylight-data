The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The EPA and other commenters requested an analysis of the potential for habitat fragmentation, identification and analysis of compensatory mitigation proposals, and consultation with the USFWS and CDFW to incorporate lessons learned from other renewable projects and recent guidance to avoid and minimize adverse effects on sensitive species. Commenters also requested that the EIS analyze impacts from shading and alteration of rainfall on vegetation and species due to panel installation and impacts on species from pile installation and construction noise. The EPA also asked that the EIS include an invasive weed management plan. Several environmental conservation organizations identified the Panoche Valley as an important bird area, and some expressed concern that the quality and quantity of mitigation lands would not compensate for the loss of core habitat.",

Preassembled PV panels would arrive on-site and be placed in a staging area inside or on shipping containers. Panels would be put in place manually and secured to the rack according to vendor specifications. The rack would be populated with panels, wired in series, and connected to a DC combiner box, which would deliver DC power to the local inverters. Equipment used for system installation would include 4x4 forklifts, all-terrain vehicles, truck-mounted pile drivers, cranes, and pickup trucks. Approximately 108 105 acres are planned for laydown and staging. Each laydown area would be at a convenient spot for construction traffic to access from existing roads. The laydown areas would require a power source for lighting, construction trailers, and parking. There would be no hazardous substances stored on-site outside of approved containment measures. The substation would be constructed by a contractor selected by the applicant, in accordance with its engineering, procurement, and construction contract specifications. The workforce at the project would vary based on activity at the site during the course of construction. Nighttime activities would have crews of 20 to 50 workers, and daytime crews would range from 100 to 500. There would be no on-site temporary workforce housing, and employees would be prohibited from parking recreational vehicles or trailers. All truck traffic and deliveries, along with approximately 40 percent of personal vehicle traffic, would enter the site from the north on Little Panoche Road. In order to accommodate the increased daily traffic volume and decrease safety risks to personal traffic, the remaining personal vehicle traffic would enter the site from the west on Panoche Road. Material deliveries and other truck traffic would be limited to using Little Panoche Road. Construction of the project substation or underground utility road crossings may require temporary closure or partial closure of roadways around the project site. An approved Traffic Control Plan has been prepared and will be implemented during construction of the project.",

The project would operate for at least 30 years, with the possibility of a subsequent repowering of the project for additional years of operation. The proposed project would operate seven days a week during daylight. Operations would consist of monitoring system status, performance, and diagnostics from the control room in the O&M building. System production forecasting and scheduling with PG&E and CAISO would also occur in the O&M building, along with operational planning. Operations would include meter reading and production reporting by the SCADA system, along with updating O&M manuals. Water would be used for sanitary facilities, fire suppression, and grazing livestock. In addition, to optimize performance of the proposed project, the PV panel surfaces may be washed up to twice annually during the dry season.",

                "summary": "The OPGW installation would be completed in approximately 12 to 16 weeks; at any one location the construction would take between 2 and 3 weeks. Existing roads and access along the transmission line would be used to install the OPGW, and PG&E would use the same methods when maintaining the electrical system. The locations of the pull/reel sites have been identified through a combination of helicopter and ground surveys and a review of aerial imagery. The criteria used in selecting the final pull/reel sites were accessibility for vehicles, presence of flat or nearly flat land next to existing transmission line route for equipment set-up, existing land use, absence of or minimal habitat for sensitive species, and absence of resources that would restrict work. Preparation of the temporary pull/splice sites would require some minor ground disturbance. Minor structural modifications would also be made to each of the transmission towers to allow splice boxes to be mounted where the sections of OPGW would be spliced (every three to five miles). The pull/reel sites and transmission towers would be accessed generally along existing unimproved roads or improved unsurfaced or surfaced roads that lead to many of the towers; no new roads would be constructed. Helicopters would be used to place materials at the point of installation for towers inaccessible by road. At each of the 75 existing towers along the 17-mile 230 kV transmission line route, minor upgrades to the steel attachments would be required to accommodate installation of the OPGW. These upgrades would include only overhead work on the existing tower, such as replacing the gode peaks with a pulley to accommodate the OPGW. The existing static wire would then be used to pull the new OPGW through each tower pulley. Existing roads or helicopters would be used to provide access to the sites to fashion the attachments needed on each tower. Construction would be completed using a combination of helicopter and ground crews. Helicopters would be used to transport electrical workers to the towers, to deliver materials, and to assist in pulling the OPGW from tower to tower. Approximately four 150-foot by 100-foot landing zones would be constructed approximately every five miles using means similar to pull sites. Establishing these landing zones would involve minimal temporary ground disturbance, and the zones would facilitate the use of helicopters and reduce overall impacts associated with the work. Landing zones would primarily be used for staging materials, picking up and transporting electrical personnel and equipment, and refueling helicopters.",

                "summary": "The Brownfield-Kettleman City site was analyzed in San Benito County\u2019s EIR for the Panoche Valley Solar Facility as one of several brownfield sites in the project area and was included in the applicant\u2019s 404(b)(1) alternatives information. The site is an active commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operated by Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and owned by Waste Management, Inc. Approximately 500 acres of the site have been approved for hazardous waste activity and are degraded; portions of the site are undeveloped. The site is used as a disposal site, and the hazardous waste facility operator (EPA Identification Number CAT000646117) applied for a permit modification in October 2013 (CDTSC 2013). The California Department of Toxic Substances Control approved this permit modification on June 23, 2014, which allowed the site to expand its landfilling activities. This effectively eliminated any potential to buy or lease the property for the construction of a PV solar facility. The site does not contain lands within the 100-year floodplain, though it does contain ephemeral drainages in the areas of greater slope. The site may contain wetlands (USFWS 2014), potential waters of the state, though no jurisdictional delineations have been performed. The San Joaquin kit fox and blunt-nosed leopard lizard, both of which are federal listed species, have been known to occur on portions of the site. Developing the site would require significant grading because many of the slopes are greater than 5 3 percent. The area of suitable slope would not provide the acreage needed to accommodate 247 MW of solar power output. This alternative was eliminated from detailed consideration in the EIS because it was of insufficient size to support a 247 MW PV generating facility and it is not available for sale or for long-term lease. Moreover, it is a brownfield site and development would likely disturb potentially contaminated soils.",
