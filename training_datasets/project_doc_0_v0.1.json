The impact would depend on the facility\u2019s location within the CREZ, though it would be a minor impact due to low viewer sensitivity.

Under Alternative A, the applicant would construct two single-span bridge crossings over Las Aguilas and Panoche Creeks rather than free-span bridges. These bridges would have a lower profile than the free-span bridges described under the no action (no permit) alternative. In addition, solar arrays would be constructed in the eastern drainages rather than in the potential solar array areas adjacent to Little Panoche Road, and the overall footprint of the solar facility would be reduced by over 350 acres. While these changes would result in a reduction in aesthetic change compared with the no action (no permit) alternative, these differences would not change the overall aesthetics as described under the no action (no permit) alternative. The applicant-proposed and County-required mitigation measures identified for the no action (no permit) alternative are also included as part of this alternative. Overall, the long-term impacts on aesthetics from Alternative A would be less than significant due to the intermittent or low visibility of the solar panels, the short viewing time of solar facility features, the low frequency of use of adjacent roadways, and maintenance of the visual quality of the background views of the Panoche Hills, Tumey Hills, Griswold Hills, and the Coast Range Mountains. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce aesthetic impacts.",

No field crops are produced on the project site. Surrounding lands also support cattle grazing, with some orchards, vineyards, and field crops grown approximately one mile southeast of the project site. Lands within the project site are no longer subject to the Williamson Act. During an initial review of the proposed project, the County determined the proposed solar project would be incompatible with the Williamson Act. Landowners on the project site with existing Williamson Act contracts subsequently initiated full or partial cancellation of 12 contracts. The San Benito County Board of Supervisors approved the cancellation of these contracts in 2010.",

Depending on the location of the project, it could also occur on lands that are now subject to Williamson Act contracts or Farmland Security Zone contracts. These contracts would need to be cancelled before a conditional use permit is issued. Lands within the Westlands CREZ are formally recognized as drainage impaired by the US Bureau of Reclamation and have been identified for retirement from irrigated agriculture by the Westlands Water District. The inability to irrigate these lands would remove them from consideration as prime farmland. Under the Williamson Act amendments contained in Senate Bill 618 (Wolk), signed into law in October 2011, the drainage-impaired lands comprising the Westlands CREZ site would be eligible for conversion to solar access easements for a term of no less than 20 years. Therefore, the proposed Westlands CREZ alternative would have a less than significant direct impact on agricultural resources. Construction would have a potentially significant indirect effect on surrounding cultivated agricultural land uses by depositing particulate matter on row crops, altering drainage and flow patterns during site construction, and impeding agricultural-related traffic on area roadways.",

All of the lands in the Westlands CREZ are formally recognized as \u201cdrainage impaired\u201d by the US Bureau of Reclamation due to the accumulation of naturally occurring salts combined with high groundwater conditions that reduces their agricultural viability. The Westlands Water District has identified these drainage-impaired lands for retirement from irrigated agriculture. Much of the land in the Westlands CREZ is under Williamson Act contract or Farmland Security Zone contract. Conversion of over 35,000 acres in the Westlands CREZ, along with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects in the study area, would constitute a potentially significant cumulative impact on agriculture, particularly in Kings County, where most of the CREZ is located. The inability to irrigate the lands in the Westlands CREZ would remove them from consideration as prime farmland. Williamson Act amendments contained in California Senate Bill 618 (2011) authorize counties to rescind Williamson Act contracts and enter into solar access easements on agricultural lands that have limited agricultural value, including Westlands CREZ lands. Construction of a proposed project under Alternative C would result in a less than significant cumulative impact on agriculture.",

Operational emissions would not exceed the Monterey Bay Unified APCD significance threshold listed in Table 3-5. In addition to the emissions shown on Table 3-8, minor emissions of toxic air pollutants would occur from vehicle and equipment use and from any minor solvent and coating use associated with equipment maintenance and building upkeep. No notable odor sources would be associated with operational activities. Direct impacts of operation-related emissions would be less than significant.

SF6 is a greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential. California Air Resources Board regulations would require the applicant to annually report SF6 emissions, determine the emission rate, and keep information current for California Air Resources Board staff inspection (17 CCR 95350). The no action (no permit) alternative would produce approximately 435,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of electrical energy per year. Production of 435,000 MWh of electrical energy from fossil fuel-fired California and western US power plants would result in an estimated 271,000 MTCO2e per year (SCEC 2010, reduced proportionally to account for a smaller project MW output). By potentially displacing natural gas and other fossil fuels used to produce electricity, PV solar installations reduce generation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The no action (no permit) alternative would generate a small amount of greenhouse gas emissions from operational and maintenance activities but overall would save approximately 155,460 MTCO2e per year, compared to a fossil fuel-fired power plant (SCEC 2010, reduced proportionally to account for a smaller project MW output). The no action (no permit) alternative would help meet California\u2019s Renewable Portfolio Standard and would contribute to the implementation of the California Global Warming Solutions Act [Assembly Bill (AB) 32]. The USGRP\u2019s Third National Climate Assessment (Melillo et al. 2014) identifies renewable energy production as an adaptation response to climate change in the Southwest to reduce urban heat stress and reduce emissions. The report states: \u201cThe Southwest\u2019s abundant geothermal, wind, and solar resources could help transform the region\u2019s electric system into one that uses substantially more renewable energy and lead to large reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions. This would also reduce the need for power plant cooling water, which will be more scarce in a hotter, drier future.\u201d",

Under these measures, the applicant will restrict the movement of construction vehicles; limit the extent of construction activities; cover open holes and trenches; preserve on-site and mitigation lands; educate to prevent inadvertent human-caused errors; monitor the site; prohibit pesticides, herbicides, firearms and pets on-site; remove trash; and reduce the likelihood for spills and exposure to hazardous substances. In addition, the applicant will conduct pre-construction surveys, avoid construction activities near blunt-nosed leopard lizard sightings, and implement a blunt-nosed leopard lizard protection plan. These measures would reduce the likelihood for take of individual blunt-nosed leopard lizard and for impacts on the Panoche population by reducing the likelihood for injury or mortality caused by construction activities, such as via vehicle strikes, entrapment, predation, or poisoning. Preservation of the Valley Floor Conservation Lands would provide corridors to allow blunt-nosed leopard lizards to disperse throughout or away from the site. In addition, conservation lands could provide areas that could be used as refugia if populations were to avoid the site. Monitoring would proactively identify and resolve issues. Because the above measures have been incorporated into the no action (no permit) alternative evaluated in this EIS, the effects on blunt-nosed leopard lizard population from construction would be less than significant. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce these impacts.",

PG&E-proposed avoidance and minimization measures were included as conditions of approval in the conditional use permit for the proposed project and are considered part of the no action (no permit) alternative in this EIS. PG&E would implement its avian protection plan to track and minimize impacts on birds and would adhere to APLIC guidelines to minimize impacts on birds or bats. It is difficult to predict the magnitude of collision-caused bird mortality as a result of the new microwave tower construction. Nevertheless, based on the distribution of the species in the project area and observations made during reconnaissance surveys, collision mortality may occur to some degree and result in a net increase of collisions compared to baseline conditions. However, because work associated with the upgrades will adhere to APLIC guidelines and PG&E\u2019s avian protection plan, it is unlikely that construction of the microwave towers would substantially reduce population numbers of migratory bird or raptor species in the work area, or cause these populations to drop below self-sustaining levels. Therefore, impacts associated with construction of PG&E\u2019s primary and secondary upgrades will be less than significant.",

Worker education would help to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent human-caused errors. Further, establishment of special status plant exclusion zones would reduce the potential for impacts caused by construction activities, such as ground disturbance. Because the above avoidance and minimization measures have been incorporated into the proposed project evaluated in this EIS, the effects on special status plant populations from construction would be less than significant. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce these impacts. Construction of the primary telecommunication upgrades could cause adverse effects on the quantity and quality of special status plant habitats. All impacts from the PG&E upgrades would be short term and localized, mainly due to soil disturbance (see Section 3.6 for a detailed discussion of potential impacts on vegetation resulting from the PG&E upgrades). The avoidance and minimization measures described above would reduce the likelihood for impacts on special status plant habitats by reducing the extent of habitat disturbance and restoring habitats on-site. Further, fire prevention measures would help to retain existing habitats in the event of a fire. Because the above avoidance and minimization measures have been incorporated into the proposed project evaluated in this EIS, the effects on special status plant habitats from construction would be less than significant. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce these impacts. Operational and maintenance activities could impact special status plants through crushing from vehicle traffic or fire ignition.

In general, impacts on special status plant species would likely be of a similar nature and type as those described for the no action (no permit) alternative and Alternatives A and B. This would particularly the case if the project were to be developed on nonagricultural parcels in the Westlands CREZ containing relatively undisturbed soils and native vegetation.

These plans identify how the quality of the surface and groundwater in the Central Valley should be managed to provide the highest water quality reasonably possible. The particular basin plan that covers the area of the proposed project is the Tulare Lake Basin Plan. It lists designated beneficial uses of water in the region, describes the water quality that must be maintained to allow for those uses, describes the programs, projects, and other actions necessary to achieve the standards established in the basin plan, and summarizes plans and policies to protect water quality. No surface waters on the proposed project site have specific designated beneficial uses, per the Water Quality Control Plan for the Tulare Lake Basin. The designated beneficial uses of West Side Streams are Agricultural Supply, Groundwater Recharge, Industrial Service Supply, Industrial Process Supply, Rare, Threatened, or Endangered Species Habitat, Water Contact Recreation, Noncontact Water Recreation, Warm Freshwater Habitat, and Wildlife Habitat. Groundwater resources in the project area (Panoche Valley Groundwater Basin) have the beneficial use designation of Municipal and Domestic Supply. In accordance with the designation, as defined by the Tulare Lake Basin Plan, 'uses of water for community, military, or individual water supply systems, including but not limited to drinking water supply' are permitted. The proposed project may not disrupt designated beneficial uses of any waters in the project area.",

The main stem of the drainage is crossed by a bridge on Little Panoche Road, which runs north-south through the proposed project. Panoche Creek flows out of the Panoche Valley, between the Panoche Hills and Tumey Hills, and northeast into the San Joaquin Valley. Las Aguilas Creek traverses the central portion of the proposed project site for approximately 18,500 feet. It is an ephemeral drainage, whose main stem is crossed by Little Panoche Road. Numerous smaller unnamed intermittent ephemeral drainages are located along the eastern boundary of the project footprint. Portions of Panoche Creek downstream of the proposed project site are on the 303(d) list for mercury, sediment toxicity, sedimentation/siltation, and selenium. The Panoche alluvial fan is the principal source of selenium from the Panoche/Silver Creek Watershed to the downstream Grasslands Watershed water bodies and the San Joaquin River.",

This report concluded that groundwater extraction during the construction phase could result in maximum groundwater drawdown of three feet near the southern edge of the property and one to two feet at locations farther off-site at the end of construction. The drawdown effects would be transient, and the water table would begin to recover once construction ends. The drawdown would most likely dissipate over roughly the same time as it developed during construction. Water levels in the water supply wells in the valley have a history of fluctuating several feet, likely as a result of intermittent pumping or seasonal changes in precipitation recharge. There is more precipitation in the winter than the summer; therefore, the predicted drawdown levels during construction are unlikely to substantially impair water supply well use in the valley and may be difficult to distinguish from natural variations. Both the Geologica report and Kleinfelder review confirm that adequate supply of water at the necessary pumping rates is available in the Panoche Valley for the proposed project. Implementation of Mitigation Measures WR-1.1 and WR-1.2 will test and monitor groundwater during construction to confirm availability of an adequate supply of water. Because impacts on groundwater supply would be temporary and mitigation measures are incorporated into the no action (no permit) alternative, the impacts on water supply would be less than significant. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce impacts.",

                "summary": "Impacts from construction are similar in nature to those described under the no action (no permit) alternative. The exact breakdown of workforce place of residence would be determined by the specific location of the project. There is a 12.9 percent and 13.5 percent annual average unemployment rate in Fresno and Kings Counties, compared to the state average of 8.9 percent. Based on these unemployment levels, the CREZ location, and current commuting patterns, it is likely that most of the workforce would be drawn from current residents of Fresno and Kings Counties. Large-scale relocation is not anticipated as a result of construction. More lodging opportunities exist near the Westlands CREZ than described under the no action (no permit) alternative; therefore, adequate temporary lodging is expected to be available in the project area. Given the relatively small number of temporary housing units that are anticipated to be needed, impacts related to construction housing would be less than significant. Local governments could benefit economically from tax revenues due to project construction. Purchase of construction-related supplies could result in direct sales tax revenue for Kings, Fresno, and neighboring counties. Approximately 20 single-family units of worker housing are in the Shannon Ranch complex, and an additional six dwellings are within one mile of the CREZ boundary. Short-term changes to quality of life due to increased noise, dust, and traffic would potentially occur for residents who live near the construction site or along travel routes to the site. Impacts and suggested mitigation measures would be as discussed in other sections and are less than significant. Impacts on residential property values from developing a solar facility at the CREZ would be less than significant.",

Potential hazards from use of these materials would be limited by adhering to APM HAZ-1 in Table C-1, which is included as part of the no action (no permit) alternative. Application of this measure would ensure impacts are less than significant by providing a protocol to reduce the risk of exposure. Minor spills on the project site could occur. In order to minimize the spills, construction personnel would be trained in handling and storing hazardous materials, in compliance with OSHA standards and APM HAZ-1, which is included as part of the no action (no permit) alternative. The project SPCC would address hazardous materials management during construction, including a hazardous materials inventory, emergency response procedures, training program information, and basic information on the location, type, quantity, and health risks of hazardous materials on the project site. Application of APM HAZ-1 and the SPCC would ensure impacts are less than significant by providing protocols to reduce the risk of exposure. Hazards from exposure to toxic materials during solar panel installation would be minimized by adhering to APM HAZ-2 in Table C-1, which is included as part of the no action (no permit) alternative. Application of this measure would ensure impacts are less than significant by providing a protocol to reduce the risk of exposure. If motor vehicle fuels or transformer fluids are spilled during transportation to the site, there could be impacts on soil, water, or vegetation. Motorists using public access routes could be exposed to these materials. Any large quantities of hazardous materials used during project construction would be transported by a licensed transporter during daylight hours, according to California Highway Patrol regulations. Application of this measure would ensure impacts are less than significant by reducing the risk of transport by inexperienced drivers and/or at nighttime hours when visibility is lower. No additional mitigation measures were identified by USACE to further reduce these impacts. Worker safety. Site-specific hazards, including electrocution, fire, accidents (slips, trips, or falls), fugitive dust inhalation, or disease transmission, could occur during construction. Health and safety procedures would be implemented, in accordance with OSHA standards, to minimize the risk of accidents or injuries. Safety planning and training sessions would occur to ensure that workers were prepared to address potential hazards. APM AQ-3 and Mitigation Measure AQ-1.1, which are included as part of the no action (no permit) alternative, would reduce emissions of fugitive dust. In addition, workers would be trained in the appropriate use of safety equipment and personal protective equipment.

The CREZ itself is bisected by a series of two-lane paved county roads. Annual average daily traffic ranges from 42,500 vehicles on Interstate 5 to 390 vehicles on Nevada Avenue within the Westlands CREZ. The level of service for the regional road network is either B or C, depending on the road. The development of a 2,506-acre solar facility in the Westlands CREZ would introduce additional vehicles to the regional road network. Delivery truck and employee traffic routes could overlap with the proposed 24,000-acre Westlands Solar Park, especially along State Routes 41 and 198 near Lemoore, during construction. Temporary increases in traffic and any accompanying degradation in road surface associated with the proposed project would be mitigated by implementing measures such as Traffic Control Plans and repairing damaged pavement.",

Any potential for glare other than what is considered \u201clow\u201d should be mitigated. The study should look at the airways nearby, the airfield less than 1 NM south, aircraft flying in the valley, and should utilize multiple geographic points and altitudes. A formal obstruction evaluation should be submitted via FAA Form 7460-1 to the FAA for analysis and a formal determination. Any additional transmission line towers or microwave should be submitted to the FAA for study as well. All photovoltaic panels should be treated, such as with anti-reflection coatings, to reduce their mirror effect and thus reduce their glare hazard. Solar panels should be angled in a manner that reduces their impact on aircraft. Glare shields should be installed if practical. Panels that are out of alignment which would put them at a hazardous angle must be repaired quickly. The AOPA supports the effort for renewable and sustainable energy. We believe these efforts can be done in a manner that will not cause an undue hazard to aviation.",

The DEIS did not explicitly address the issues with establishing biological baselines using data collected in drought years. There are serious issues with using data collected in 2013 and 2014, when populations of giant kangaroo rats and blunt-nosed leopard lizards, for example, were at their lowest levels in the past 30+ years. The DEIS should have assessed the viability of populations of giant kangaroo rat, San Joaquin kit fox, and blunt-nosed leopard lizard, considering current (and projected) population size, range, existing and proposed land uses (cumulative effects), drought-induced effects, and the Project\u2019s direct and indirect impacts.",

As we discussed in the meeting (October 23, 2015), the Panoche Valley Solar Project is proposed in a location that is extremely sensitive from an ecological perspective, representing some of the last remnants of San Joaquin Valley grassland habitat, critical for species such as the San Joaquin Valley kit fox, the giant kangaroo rat and the blunt-nosed leopard lizard. We have repeatedly communicated this to San Benito County, to each of the developers of the project as they have changed, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. While we do not believe that this particular location is appropriate for a solar facility, we want to reiterate our commitment to support lower impact and lower conflict solar development in the Central Valley and in San Benito County. Additionally, The Nature Conservancy has offered to offer to work with the developers to purchase the Panoche Valley land and seek to find a more suitable location for this project.",

Human disturbance is a known threat to the species, with the likelihood that nest failures occur predominantly from human disturbance (Pagel et. al 2010). Clear line of sight of humans or human disturbance can cause a significant change in a raptor\u2019s habitat usage (Richardson and Miller 1997). The impacts on Golden Eagles from human disturbance can be very large with a suggested buffer of 800 meters for all human disturbances, extending to 1600 meters (Richardson and Miller 1997). This suggested buffer area calls into question whether the project will be able to reduce impacts to Golden Eagle without protecting the nests and providing additional suitable lands near occupied Golden eagle nests to compensate for lost foraging habitat. Additionally, since Golden eagle is a Fully Protected Species under California state law, the proposed Project may need to acquire appropriate state \u201ctake\u201d permit for Golden eagle as well by adopting a Natural Communities Conservation Plan, which is currently the only mechanism that allows for the issuance of a \u201ctake\u201d permit for fully protected species such as the Golden eagle in the state of California. This requirement is not analyzed in the DEIS.",

It is my professional opinion that the project will have substantial and unmitigable impacts on the species that would forever preclude its recovery and de-listing from the Federal and California Endangered Species lists. According to USFWS regulations, jeopardy results when it is reasonable to expect that a federal action would 'reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species in the wild by reducing the reproduction, numbers, or distribution of that species' (50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.02). Due to the permanent loss of habitat that the project would entail, as well as the negative impact on giant kangaroo rats during one of the worst droughts in recorded memory, I believe that this project would reduce reproduction, numbers and the distribution of the species.",

When it was first proposed, I opposed it because I was concerned that they did not have adequate resources to fulfill the enormous amount of mitigation they promised. They have since proved me wrong. They have shown they have adequate resources. Mitigation measures are more than adequate. They are not minimal. I have no financial interest in this at all. And I have no political interest in this at all. I would support this project if there were no jobs and no money coming to the county. And the reason is, that I believe that America's very vulnerable because it is not energy independent. And this project is just another step toward energy independence. The people at the Corps of Engineers and other government agencies are there to make judgments. If they didn't want them to use their brains, we could have robots decide. So, I ask you to take everything into account. The EIR is not absolutely perfect. I've seen a thousand projects. I've never seen a perfect EIR. Those who oppose it just want it gone. They do not want it improved, so they're examining",

I loved being here as a home owner, as a resident and as a family person. I was very disappointed that I had to go outside of the county in order to make my income match my needs. I've been an advocate for solar since the '70s. I went to UCSC, majored in environmental studies, communities studies, with the intention of going into that field. Other things took place, so I went into the construction field. I saw the benefit of solar both on a large scale commercial as well as residential. I have seen the impact of P.G.&E. across the state and realized that with the power line centrally going through the county, it only made sense that we would put the two together and have clean energy as a source right here in the county. I am a proponent of job creation and being able to work here in the county.",

And the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to this community, it is just unthinkable that things are going to happen to this community, to businesses, for businesses, to farm workers. Upgrade their skills and get the jobs of tomorrow. That's what they're looking for: Construction. And I think this project has done everything it can to mitigate any impact. And that's why it's moving forward. And it is unfortunate that some don't want it. And I respect that, but I think the overall benefit to any community supersedes any impact, if there was any, to the environment and that has been mitigated. I totally support this project. I've been working in San Benito for many, many years and continue to do so, but this really brings -- this is the wave that brings almost, you know, moves us forward. So it is 100 percent supported and hoping that it happens sooner.",

The study analyzed whether glint and glare would be visible to offsite viewers and what the duration and intensity of glint and glare would be, should it be present. The study used the Key Observation Points described in the analysis of aesthetics (see Section 3.2, Aesthetics). Glint and glare may be visible to aircraft during midmorning to afternoon hours for all positions studied. These occurrences are dependent on altitude, relationship to the project area, and panel position. Due to the position of the panels and because the panel faces would be non\u2010reflective black or blue, the study concluded that aircraft would not be affected by the proposed project (Power Engineers 2010c).",

The project footprint density estimates are not available in the literature. The only colony evaluated in Williams (1992) from the Panoche Valley was not trapped, and no density estimate was calculated specifically for that giant kangaroo rat colony. In the Panoche region, other density estimates are available for Silver Creek Ranch, the vicinity of Valadeao Ranch, and on the east side of the Panoche Region in the vicinity of the Panoche Creek alluvial fan. Of these colonies, densities in the project footprint are likely more similar to densities within Valadeao Ranch than Silver Creek Ranch or Panoche Creek, given the very high-quality habitat conditions present in the latter two areas. Therefore, using the maximum measured density for the Valadeao Ranch area (7.90 giant kangaroo rats per acre), up to 343 giant kangaroo rats may be present within the project footprint using the applicant\u2019s estimate. For the Final EIS, USACE determined that it was appropriate to use an estimated number of giant kangaroo rats that may occur in the footprint consisting of the number of giant kangaroo rats estimated by the applicant as the low range, and a high range of the maximum number of giant kangaroo rats authorized to be relocated by USFWS in its Biological Opinion.",

Figure 3-10 of the Draft and Final EIS shows an overview of special-status species observations (including blunt-nosed leopard lizard) on the project site and the mitigation lands. Through the conservation strategy described in the EIS, the applicant has committed to acquiring 25,618 acres of mitigation land. As described, these mitigation lands include approximately 13,325 acres of suitable habitat within the Panoche Valley, adjacent to the proposed project site. The EIS does not determine that there are not genetically distinct populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizard lizards throughout their range, nor does the EIS indicate that the Panoche Hills, Panoche Valley, and Silver Creek Ranch populations of blunt-nosed leopard lizard are genetically the same. New data regarding the genetic variability of blunt-nosed leopard lizard populations on or near the proposed project site was requested from the USGS; however, the USGS has a strict policy that precludes it from circulating draft/incomplete papers that have not.",

Conservation of these lands along with conservation lands established by solar facilities in the Carrizo Plains would provide a series of large, protected habitat areas for the species to inhabit. Although some occupied and suitable habitat would be removed and mortality of a few individuals is expected, implementation of the proposed project would have minimal effect on, and would not impede recovery of the species due to preservation of important occupied habitat in the conservation lands and the capture and relocation measures incorporated into the project to minimize mortality to giant kangaroo rats (p. 70).",

The species\u2019 larger geographic range includes portions of at least five counties on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley.

                    "content": "The EIS conservatively assumes a carpool rate of 1.2 passengers per vehicle. While carpooling is not required, the USACE feels it is reasonable to assume some personnel will carpool, especially given the distance between the proposed project site and municipalities where personnel may reside. Carpooling reduces fuel costs and depreciation on car values. It also accounts for workers who may not own an automobile. The USACE agrees that the percentage of workers using a given commuting route should mirror the percentage of workers residing in municipalities along that route. As a result, the Final EIS has been revised to state that 75 percent of workers would commute via State Route 25 and Panoche Road, and 25 percent of workers would commute via Interstate 5 and Little Panoche Road. The analysis in Section 3.15.3 has been revised to account for these percentages. The estimate of which areas and municipalities workers would be drawn from is based on the best professional judgement of the applicant. Factors including distance to the project site, local and regional population, and employment statistics were used to make this determination. As identified in the EIS, with the additional traffic, both Panoche Road and Little Panoche Road would remain LOS A, and therefore the impacts of the proposed project on traffic would be less than significant. The Draft EIS analyzes the indirect impacts of traffic levels on regional roads expected to be used during construction; these include roads or sections of roads outside of the project area that would be used for deliveries and commuting. Examples include Highway 25, Interstate 5, Panoche Road, and Little Panoche Road.",

In addition, in their Biological Opinion, USFWS stated: \u201cThe project could disrupt normal life history patterns of some individual San Joaquin kit foxes within one of the three core populations for San Joaquin kit fox: the Ciervo-Panoche Natural Area (Service 1998). The proposed project would also permanently remove some occupied, optimal habitat in the Ciervo-Panoche Natural Area. The avoidance, minimization, and conservation measures are expected to reduce these effects to the species in the area and minimize adverse effects to recovery efforts. In particular, the project design incorporates a habitat corridor that allows for more site permeability from north to south and allows for movement between lands conserved as part of the proposed project. The corridor is expected to provide a path of suitable habitat for San Joaquin kit fox occupation and movement through the area which will allow for continued function of the Ciervo-Panoche Natural Area. Based on information from similar solar power projects in the Carrizo Plains, the Service concludes that San Joaquin kit fox can persist, at least in the short term, in and around solar arrays. With the protection of lands to the north and south of the project site and the habitat corridor to through the project footprint, the function of the Ciervo-Panoche Natural Area will be maintained and recovery of the species will not be impeded by the proposed project.\u201d",

The rationale by the commenters that \u201cthe additive impact from development undoubtedly affects this highly endangered canid\u201d is not clear, as no evidence has been provided that would lead to the reasonable conclusion that mortality from a bobcat and lack of evidence of reproduction is the result of the off-site construction of a solar facility.

In the Draft EIS, lands between zero and 11 percent slope were considered optimally suitable. Lands with slope over 11 percent were presumed to be less than optimally suitable, with the proportion of lands considered suitable contingent upon the slope value. For example, half of all lands between 11.01 and 21 percent slope were considered suitable, one-quarter of all lands between 21.01 and 35 percent slope were considered suitable, and no lands over 35 percent slope were considered suitable. These classes and proportions are based on results of scat-sniffing dog survey results. However, based on subsequent USFWS input and as stated in the Biological Opinion, only lands between zero and 11 percent slope in an open landscape are considered suitable habitat for San Joaquin kit fox. As a result of this determination, the Final EIS has been revised to state that the proposed project would preserve approximately 10,000 acres of San Joaquin kit fox habitat in the on-site and off-site conservation lands. Overall, the no action (no permit) alternative, Alternative A, and Alternative B would result in permanent adverse effects to between 1,688 and 1,796 acres of suitable habitat for San Joaquin kit fox, and would result in the on-site and off-site preservation of between approximately 10,000 and 11,442 acres of suitable habitat for San Joaquin kit fox on the conservation lands.",

Research from Searcy and Schaffer (2011) and Searcy et al. (2013) from the Jepson Prairie Preserve in Solano County has been incorporated into Section 3.6 of the Final EIS. The Biological Opinion specified a number of conservation measures to protect California tiger salamander, including pre-construction surveys, erecting exclusion fencing within 1.2 miles of breeding ponds, a relocation plan, ceasing work if rain exceeds 0.25 inches within a 24-hour period, and creation of breeding ponds on conservation lands. The Biological Opinion is included as Appendix G of the Final EIS. Section 3.6 of the Final EIS discusses and analyzes the direct and indirect effects of the alternatives on California tiger salamander and analyzes mitigation measures identified in Appendix C of the EIS as well as any new measures included in the Biological Opinion (Appendix G) and Incidental Take Permit (Appendix I). Per the California Tiger Salamander Pre-construction Avoidance and Minimization Plan dated March 2015 and included in Appendix H, burrow excavations for the project will be conducted where ground-disturbing activities are proposed in the project footprint out to 700 meters (2,300 feet) from each identified breeding pond. Burrow excavations will be conducted in all areas to be graded (e.g., arrays, roads, buildings, mitigation pond creation, etc.).",

In some cases, the analysis identifies specific measure(s) in the plan that will mitigate impacts, and the analysis accounts for these measures. In other cases, no specific measures are identified, but a certain level of mitigation is anticipated because the plan would be subject to approval by applicable permitting authorities such as San Benito County and/or the County would approve the qualified individual who would be responsible for developing the plan. Since the availability of the Draft EIS, numerous plans, including several of those listed by the commenter, have been developed, as shown in Table 1-2 and available plans are included in Appendix H.

American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists 2015 Annual Meeting, Reno, NV, July 15-19, 2015. Excerpt from the abstract: \u201cWe used mtDNA sequences, microsatellite allele frequency data, and restriction associated digest sequences from 18 locations covering the range of G. sila to test the extent to which population structuring and gene exchange were shaped by mesic habitat or other barriers within this otherwise desert ecoregion. Our results suggest that wetland and riparian areas did little to impede historical movement across the Valley floor, and instead point to precipitation patterns owing to topographic effects as a more cogent factor in determining population structuring and directionality of gene flow.\u201d",

Researchers inspected sites with potential habitat for giant kangaroo rats in western Fresno and eastern San Benito counties between June and August 1992. In June 1993, they revisited sites to take tissue samples for genetic studies, and discovered additional giant kangaroo rat colonies. The largest colonies were found on Panoche and Mugata fine sandy-loam soils, with small colonies on various soil textures. All colonies were located in annual grassland-dominated communities. The extant colonies occupied an estimated area of 1,882.8 ha, a significant increase from previous studies. The estimated population size in 1992-93 was 37,125, up from approximately 2,000 in the 1980s due to a population irruption starting in summer 1991.",

Home range size, core area size, and amount of overlap of ranges did not differ significantly between sites. The difference in average home range size between males and females was borderline significant. Female home ranges and core areas were overlapped extensively by male ranges. At the more densely vegetated site, leopard lizards used washes significantly more than grassland, floodplain, and road habitats and they used grassland significantly less than other habitats. At the sparsely vegetated site, grassland was used more than wash habitat and hills were used less than all other habitats. The data indicate that leopard lizard activity is concentrated in washes and other open areas when herbaceous cover is dense, but they are capable of utilizing the more extensive grassland habitat if vegetation is sufficiently sparse. Creating open space within the grassland habitat may have important management implications for this species in some areas.",

The extreme drought of 2014 provided a unique opportunity to test models of persistence in the face of climate change in the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Gambelia sila. Due to an existing partnership between the Bureau of Land Management, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Nature Conservancy, and UC Santa Cruz, personnel were able to mobilize within a matter of days when preliminary data suggested that lizards were not recruiting in some populations. By conducting rigorous surveys, field workers were able to gather meaningful data from over 20 sites within the narrow window when neonate lizards could be observed, resulting in a dataset that confirmed a strong causal link between drought and recruitment on Gambelia sila and also provided a geographic visualization of the drought by recruitment interaction.",
