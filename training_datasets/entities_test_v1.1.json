Vol. 77, No. 139, p. 42488), the USACE initiated a 30-day scoping period for this EIS; this period was extended by nearly 20 days to end on September 7, 2012. The NOI was published in the Hollister Free Lance on July 31 and August 3, 2012. Also, it was mailed to federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals known to have an interest in the project. The NOI invited the public to provide information on environmental impacts that could occur as a result of the proposed project as proposed in 2012. Copies of these materials are in Appendix A of this EIS. Public scoping meetings were held on August 21, 2012, at the Panoche School in Paicines, California, and on August 22, 2012, at the Veterans Memorial Building in Hollister, California. The meetings began with an open house that served as an informal question and answer session, followed by a formal presentation and oral comments. Eleven people attended the scoping meeting in Paicines, and six entered comments into the public record; thirty people attended the scoping meeting in Hollister, and nine entered comments into the public record. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments to accurately capture the information presented at the meetings. The scoping period ended on September 7, 2012. Twenty written comment letters were submitted by the following agencies, tribes, and organizations and by 12 individuals (in all, 21 individuals commented with either written or oral comments).",
