The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

Vol. 77, No. 139, p. 42488), the USACE initiated a 30-day scoping period for this EIS; this period was extended by nearly 20 days to end on September 7, 2012. The NOI was published in the Hollister Free Lance on July 31 and August 3, 2012. Also, it was mailed to federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals known to have an interest in the project. The NOI invited the public to provide information on environmental impacts that could occur as a result of the proposed project as proposed in 2012. Copies of these materials are in Appendix A of this EIS. Public scoping meetings were held on August 21, 2012, at the Panoche School in Paicines, California, and on August 22, 2012, at the Veterans Memorial Building in Hollister, California. The meetings began with an open house that served as an informal question and answer session, followed by a formal presentation and oral comments. Eleven people attended the scoping meeting in Paicines, and six entered comments into the public record; thirty people attended the scoping meeting in Hollister, and nine entered comments into the public record. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments to accurately capture the information presented at the meetings. The scoping period ended on September 7, 2012. Twenty written comment letters were submitted by the following agencies, tribes, and organizations and by 12 individuals (in all, 21 individuals commented with either written or oral comments).",

The second meeting was held on October 7, 2015, at the Panoche Elementary School in Paicines, California. The meetings were conducted in an open house format. Informational posters and a PowerPoint presentation provided information on the proposed project evaluated in the Draft EIS, the NEPA process, and the USACE regulatory program. Representatives from the USACE, the project applicant, and the EIS preparer were available to answer questions. A court reporter was present at the meetings to enter verbal comments into the public record. Twenty-eight people attended the public meeting on October 6, 2015, and nineteen individuals entered verbal comments into the public record. Fifteen people attended the public meeting on October 7, 2015, and no attendees entered verbal comments into the public record.

Because PG&E has proposed as part of the no action (no permit) alternative to implement BMPs and revegetation measures to reduce any temporary effects on soil and vegetation, direct and indirect impacts would be less than significant.

As the Panoche Valley has not been recommended or identified as a rural historic landscape, and many of its component parts lack integrity, the alterations in the landscape setting would not result in an adverse effect under the NHPA or a significant impact under NEPA. Proposed project operations would not encounter unanticipated resources due to the lack of surface-disturbing actions. However, if such discoveries were made, the measures included as part of the no action (no permit) alternative would reduce the potential for adversely affecting previously undiscovered cultural artifacts or human remains. With implementation of these measures, operational-related impacts would be less than significant and would not constitute an adverse effect under the NHPA or a significant effect under NEPA. All identified cultural resources near telecommunication upgrade sites would be outside of the PG&E work areas or would be avoided. Therefore, there would be no direct effects on any of the identified cultural resources.",

Operational and maintenance activities for the solar facility are allowable activities and would not conflict with any local plans or regulations. These activities would not divide a community or disrupt uses on surrounding lands. Impacts would be less than significant.",

                "summary": "The applicant submitted a Department of the Army permit application in April 2010 for a 420 MW solar facility. The applicant submitted a revised permit application in December 2010 for a 399 MW solar facility (the project approved by San Benito County in 2010); it was estimated in this application that project impacts would include 427 cubic yards of fill into Panoche and Las Aguilas Creeks. The applicant submitted alternatives information to the USACE in November 2012 (Power Engineers 2012) and in December 2014 submitted revised alternatives information. This revised information accounted for changes in the proposed project resulting from biological survey information, interconnection requirements by PG&E, and revisions to the jurisdictional determination (Energy Renewal Partners 2014). The applicant\u2019s current alternatives information (Energy Renewal Partners 2015b), submitted to the USACE in August December 2015, is included in Appendix B. The USACE has not reviewed this updated alternatives information but is providing it for the public to comment on. The applicant\u2019s preferred alternative (Alternative A) described in the 2014 alternatives information included project impacts of approximately 6 cubic yards of cut and 5 cubic yards of fill in Panoche Creek, 10 11 cubic yards of cut and 10 cubic yards of fill in Las Aguilas Creek, and 22 cubic yards of cut and 646 cubic yards of fill in three unnamed ephemeral drainages in the eastern portion of the project footprint. Impacts to Panoche Creek were eliminated based on a letter from the Hollister Fire Department dated August 27, 2015, indicating that it would be acceptable to eliminate a bridge over Panoche Creek provided all other emergency access elements be retained and constructed and emergency access areas be established on the site. This would amount to a total discharge of fill material into 0.121 acre of waters of the U.S. in the project footprint. This is evaluated as Alternative A (Applicant\u2019s Proposed Project Preferred Alternative) and is described in Section 2.5. In addition, the applicant is proposing 0.096 acre of potential impacts to waters of the U.S. associated with debris removal in two ephemeral drainages on the conservation lands proposed as compensatory mitigation for the proposed loss of waters of the U.S. associated with the applicant\u2019s preferred alternative.",

Panels would be put in place manually and secured to the rack according to vendor specifications. The rack would be populated with panels, wired in series, and connected to a DC combiner box, which would deliver DC power to the local inverters. Equipment used for system installation would include 4x4 forklifts, all-terrain vehicles, truck-mounted pile drivers, cranes, and pickup trucks. Approximately 108 105 acres are planned for laydown and staging. Each laydown area would be at a convenient spot for construction traffic to access from existing roads. The laydown areas would require a power source for lighting, construction trailers, and parking. There would be no hazardous substances stored on-site outside of approved containment measures.",

                "summary": "The applicant\u2019s proposed project has evolved over time, first through the San Benito County permitting process and CEQA analysis, and then through coordination with the USFWS and the CDFW, which resulted in the currently proposed project (identified as the applicant\u2019s preferred alternative (Alternative A) in this Final EIS). A number of project configurations and project output capacities have been studied at the project site. During preparation of this EIS, the USACE continued to evaluate alternative site configurations to further reduce impacts on aquatic resources (fill into waters of the U.S.) and sensitive biological resources. On-site alternatives evaluated in the applicant\u2019s 404(b)(1) alternatives information, alternative configurations and capacities suggested by agencies and the public during project scoping, and alternative configurations investigated with the USFWS and CDFW were evaluated for their ability to meet the project purpose and need. The goal in developing on-site alternative configurations was to reduce impacts likely to be associated with the project as currently proposed, with an emphasis on reducing impacts on aquatic resources (fill into waters of the U.S.). No alternative configurations were found that further minimized impacts on waters of the U.S. and sensitive biological species, while still providing a project output of 247 MW, as specified in the overall project purpose. One alternative was found that reduced aquatic impacts by avoiding placing fill into Panoche and Las Aguilas Creeks (waters of the U.S.). However, this alternative would not provide for adequate emergency access to the site required by the Hollister Fire Chief (Hollister Fire Department 2014, 2015), so it was not evaluated in detail. The alternative configurations analyzed and the reasons they were eliminated from detailed review are described in Section 2.8. In compliance with USACE NEPA regulations (33 CFR, Part 325, Appendix B), one alternative is being evaluated that avoids all impacts to waters of the U.S. Due to the location of waters of the U.S. on the project site, the USACE determined that it is appropriate to analyze a no action alternative that constructs a 247 MW solar facility in a manner that avoids waters of the U.S. and the subsequent need for a Department of the Army permit.",

The lighting would consist of energy-efficient lamps that would be lit only when human activity is detected. Motion sensors would be set to avoid activation by animals. In addition to lighting, security cameras would be installed near the lighting to monitor activity. Constant low-level lighting would be required at the O&M building. This would include a single lamp source near the entrance of the building, which would be activated by a timer. All lighting would include a power switch to conserve energy when the lighting is not required.

Existing roads and access along the transmission line would be used to install the OPGW, and PG&E would use the same methods when maintaining the electrical system. The locations of the pull/reel sites have been identified through a combination of helicopter and ground surveys and a review of aerial imagery. The criteria used in selecting the final pull/reel sites were accessibility for vehicles, presence of flat or nearly flat land next to existing transmission line route for equipment set-up, existing land use, absence of or minimal habitat for sensitive species, and absence of resources that would restrict work. Preparation of the temporary pull/splice sites would require some minor ground disturbance. Minor structural modifications would also be made to each of the transmission towers to allow splice boxes to be mounted where the sections of OPGW would be spliced (every three to five miles). The pull/reel sites and transmission towers would be accessed generally along existing unimproved roads or improved unsurfaced or surfaced roads that lead to many of the towers; no new roads would be constructed. Helicopters would be used to place materials at the point of installation for towers inaccessible by road. At each of the 75 existing towers along the 17-mile 230 kV transmission line route, minor upgrades to the steel attachments would be required to accommodate installation of the OPGW. These upgrades would include only overhead work on the existing tower, such as replacing the gode peaks with a pulley to accommodate the OPGW. The existing static wire would then be used to pull the new OPGW through each tower pulley. Existing roads or helicopters would be used to provide access to the sites to fashion the attachments needed on each tower. Construction would be completed using a combination of helicopter and ground crews. Helicopters would be used to transport electrical workers to the towers, to deliver materials, and to assist in pulling the OPGW from tower to tower. Approximately four 150-foot by 100-foot landing zones would be constructed approximately every five miles using means similar to pull sites. Establishing these landing zones would involve minimal temporary ground disturbance, and the zones would facilitate the use of helicopters and reduce overall impacts associated with the work. Landing zones would primarily be used for staging materials, picking up and transporting electrical personnel and equipment, and refueling helicopters.",
