The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The lead agency for this project is the US Army Corps of Engineers, which determined that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was necessary. The facility includes a solar field, an electrical collection system, and a project substation. Electricity generated will be delivered via new on-site switching station to the existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line and sold to Southern California Edison.",

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The project site contains ephemeral drainages determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S.; thus, construction requires a permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The project involves a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules, an electrical collection system converting power from direct current to alternating current, and a project substation converting power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity will be delivered via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line, and sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.",

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line.
