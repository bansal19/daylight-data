The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.", "capacity": "247 megawatt", "technology": "photovoltaic solar generating facility"}, "Persons": [{"name": "Lisa Gibson", "email": "Lisa.M.Gibson2@usace.army.mil", "phone": "(916) 557-5288", "role": "US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District - Regulatory Division"}], "Organizations": [{"name": "US Army Corps of Engineers", "type": "Federal", "acronym": null, "fullName": "US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District", "role": "Lead Federal Agency", "isApplicant": false}, {"name": "US Fish and Wildlife Service", "type": "Federal", "acronym": null, "fullName": "US Fish and Wildlife Service", "role": "Cooperating Agency", "isApplicant": false}, {"name": "Panoche Valley Solar, LLC", "type": "Private", "acronym": null, "fullName": "Panoche Valley Solar, LLC", "role": "Applicant", "isApplicant": true}, {"name": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company", "type": "Private", "acronym": "PG&E", "fullName": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company", "role": "Electricity Transmission", "isApplicant": false}, {"name": "Southern California Edison", "type": "Private", "acronym": "SCE", "fullName": "Southern California Edison", "role": "Electricity Purchaser", "isApplicant": false}], "Comments": [{"content": "The Draft EIS was distributed for public review and comment from September 11, 2015 to October 26, 2015.
