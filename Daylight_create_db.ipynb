The proposed project site contains \\nephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S.  \\nConstruction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in \\naccordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, \\nas the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy \\nAct, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major \\nfederal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the \\npreparation of an environmental impact statement was required.  \\nThe proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic \\nmodules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct \\ncurrent to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project \\nsubstation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. \\nThe electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric \\nCompany switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt \\ntransmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison \\nunder a long-term power purchase agreement.  \\nComments: The Draft EIS was distributed for public review and comment from September 11, 2015 \\nto October 26, 2015. On October 6, 2015 and October 7, 2015, the USACE held public \\nmeetings on the Draft EIS. This Final EIS responds to the substantive comments received \\non the Draft EIS during the public review and comment period. \\n\",\n",

The proposed project site contains \\nephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S.  \\nConstruction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in \\naccordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, \\nas the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy \\nAct, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major \\nfederal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the \\npreparation of an environmental impact statement was required.  \\nThe proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic \\nmodules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct \\ncurrent to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project \\nsubstation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. \\nThe electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric \\nCompany switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt \\ntransmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison \\nunder a long-term power purchase agreement.  \\nComments: The Draft EIS was distributed for public review and comment from September 11, 2015 \\nto October 26, 2015. On October 6, 2015 and October 7, 2015, the USACE held public \\nmeetings on the Draft EIS. This Final EIS responds to the substantive comments received \\non the Draft EIS during the public review and comment period. \\n', 'Page NER': [{'text': 'Lead Federal Agency', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.17294186353683472}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9365793466567993}, {'text': 'Cooperating Agency', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.11888692528009415}, {'text': 'US Fish and Wildlife Service', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.8284392952919006}, {'text': 'Title', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.1506432443857193}, {'text': 'Final Environmental Impact Statement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.31138914823532104}, {'text': 'Panoche Valley Solar Facility', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.11137910187244415}, {'text': 'San Benito County California', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.7354955673217773}, {'text': 'Final EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.19853344559669495}, {'text': 'Lisa Gibson', 'label': 'Name', 'score': 0.9522926807403564}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9234023690223694}, {'text': 'Sacramento District Regulatory Division', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.30719417333602905}, {'text': '1325 J Street', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.306429386138916}, {'text': 'Sacramento CA', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.3613952398300171}, {'text': 'LisaMGibson2', 'label': 'Name', 'score': 0.414144903421402}, {'text': 'Panoche Valley Solar LLC', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.266710102558136}, {'text': 'San Benito County', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.8471260666847229}, {'text': 'California', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.6058362722396851}, {'text': 'proposed project site', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.10010280460119247}, {'text': 'ephemeral drainages', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.48255905508995056}, {'text': 'jurisdictional waters', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.13902460038661957}, {'text': 'Department of the Army', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.7256342768669128}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9399042725563049}, {'text': 'Section 404', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.5461686849594116}, {'text': 'Section 404', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.23407652974128723}, {'text': 'Clean Water Act', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.26868316531181335}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.8967344164848328}, {'text': 'National Environmental Policy Act', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7782594561576843}, {'text': 'environmental impact statement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.20243534445762634}, {'text': 'solar field', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.14172741770744324}, {'text': 'project substation', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.2622216045856476}, {'text': 'project substation', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.29545003175735474}, {'text': 'Pacific Gas and Electric Company', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.6922793388366699}, {'text': 'Moss Landing Panoche', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.7712411284446716}, {'text': 'Southern California Edison', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.7862821221351624}, {'text': 'long term power purchase agreement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.13081443309783936}, {'text': 'Comments', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.11421391367912292}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7818824648857117}, {'text': 'September 11 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9448677897453308}, {'text': 'October 26 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9005503058433533}, {'text': 'October 6 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9230325222015381}, {'text': 'October 7 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.8911306262016296}, {'text': 'USACE', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.923857569694519}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.8509547114372253}, {'text': 'Final EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.5928794145584106}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7933935523033142}]}\n",
