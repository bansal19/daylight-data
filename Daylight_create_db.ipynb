The proposed project site contains \\nephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S.  \\nConstruction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in \\naccordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, \\nas the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy \\nAct, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major \\nfederal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the \\npreparation of an environmental impact statement was required.  \\nThe proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic \\nmodules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct \\ncurrent to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project \\nsubstation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. \\nThe electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric \\nCompany switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt \\ntransmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison \\nunder a long-term power purchase agreement.  \\nComments: The Draft EIS was distributed for public review and comment from September 11, 2015 \\nto October 26, 2015. On October 6, 2015 and October 7, 2015, the USACE held public \\nmeetings on the Draft EIS. This Final EIS responds to the substantive comments received \\non the Draft EIS during the public review and comment period. \\n\",\n",

The proposed project site contains \\nephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S.  \\nConstruction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from \\nthe US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in \\naccordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, \\nas the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy \\nAct, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major \\nfederal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the \\npreparation of an environmental impact statement was required.  \\nThe proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic \\nmodules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct \\ncurrent to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project \\nsubstation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. \\nThe electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric \\nCompany switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt \\ntransmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison \\nunder a long-term power purchase agreement.  \\nComments: The Draft EIS was distributed for public review and comment from September 11, 2015 \\nto October 26, 2015. On October 6, 2015 and October 7, 2015, the USACE held public \\nmeetings on the Draft EIS. This Final EIS responds to the substantive comments received \\non the Draft EIS during the public review and comment period. \\n', 'Page NER': [{'text': 'Lead Federal Agency', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.17294186353683472}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9365793466567993}, {'text': 'Cooperating Agency', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.11888692528009415}, {'text': 'US Fish and Wildlife Service', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.8284392952919006}, {'text': 'Title', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.1506432443857193}, {'text': 'Final Environmental Impact Statement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.31138914823532104}, {'text': 'Panoche Valley Solar Facility', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.11137910187244415}, {'text': 'San Benito County California', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.7354955673217773}, {'text': 'Final EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.19853344559669495}, {'text': 'Lisa Gibson', 'label': 'Name', 'score': 0.9522926807403564}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9234023690223694}, {'text': 'Sacramento District Regulatory Division', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.30719417333602905}, {'text': '1325 J Street', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.306429386138916}, {'text': 'Sacramento CA', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.3613952398300171}, {'text': 'LisaMGibson2', 'label': 'Name', 'score': 0.414144903421402}, {'text': 'Panoche Valley Solar LLC', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.266710102558136}, {'text': 'San Benito County', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.8471260666847229}, {'text': 'California', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.6058362722396851}, {'text': 'proposed project site', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.10010280460119247}, {'text': 'ephemeral drainages', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.48255905508995056}, {'text': 'jurisdictional waters', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.13902460038661957}, {'text': 'Department of the Army', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.7256342768669128}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.9399042725563049}, {'text': 'Section 404', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.5461686849594116}, {'text': 'Section 404', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.23407652974128723}, {'text': 'Clean Water Act', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.26868316531181335}, {'text': 'US Army Corps of Engineers', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.8967344164848328}, {'text': 'National Environmental Policy Act', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7782594561576843}, {'text': 'environmental impact statement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.20243534445762634}, {'text': 'solar field', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.14172741770744324}, {'text': 'project substation', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.2622216045856476}, {'text': 'project substation', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.29545003175735474}, {'text': 'Pacific Gas and Electric Company', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.6922793388366699}, {'text': 'Moss Landing Panoche', 'label': 'Location', 'score': 0.7712411284446716}, {'text': 'Southern California Edison', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.7862821221351624}, {'text': 'long term power purchase agreement', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.13081443309783936}, {'text': 'Comments', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.11421391367912292}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7818824648857117}, {'text': 'September 11 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9448677897453308}, {'text': 'October 26 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9005503058433533}, {'text': 'October 6 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.9230325222015381}, {'text': 'October 7 2015', 'label': 'Date', 'score': 0.8911306262016296}, {'text': 'USACE', 'label': 'Agency', 'score': 0.923857569694519}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.8509547114372253}, {'text': 'Final EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.5928794145584106}, {'text': 'Draft EIS', 'label': 'Title', 'score': 0.7933935523033142}]}\n",

The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement.\",\n",

Additional changes to the applicant\\u2019s proposed project have been made since the Draft EIS was published. These changes are the result of further consultation with or the issuance of permits by other regulatory agencies, all of which have reduced project impacts. The revised project as described is identified as the applicant\\u2019s preferred alternative in this Final EIS. Overall, the project footprint was reduced by 352 acres from the project analyzed in the Draft EIS. An additional approximately 93 acres of land within the two temporary laydown yards would also be converted to conservation land after construction is complete, yielding a total of approximately 442 acres of additional conservation land beyond what was identified in the Draft EIS.\",\n",

Preassembled PV panels would arrive on-site and be placed in a staging area inside or on shipping containers. Panels would be put in place manually and secured to the rack according to vendor specifications. The rack would be populated with panels, wired in series, and connected to a DC combiner box, which would deliver DC power to the local inverters. Equipment used for system installation would include 4x4 forklifts, all-terrain vehicles, truck-mounted pile drivers, cranes, and pickup trucks. Approximately 108 105 acres are planned for laydown and staging. Each laydown area would be at a convenient spot for construction traffic to access from existing roads. The laydown areas would require a power source for lighting, construction trailers, and parking. There would be no hazardous substances stored on-site outside of approved containment measures. The substation would be constructed by a contractor selected by the applicant, in accordance with its engineering, procurement, and construction contract specifications. The workforce at the project would vary based on activity at the site during the course of construction. Nighttime activities would have crews of 20 to 50 workers, and daytime crews would range from 100 to 500. There would be no on-site temporary workforce housing, and employees would be prohibited from parking recreational vehicles or trailers. All truck traffic and deliveries, along with approximately 40 percent of personal vehicle traffic, would enter the site from the north on Little Panoche Road. In order to accommodate the increased daily traffic volume and decrease safety risks to personal traffic, the remaining personal vehicle traffic would enter the site from the west on Panoche Road. Material deliveries and other truck traffic would be limited to using Little Panoche Road. Construction of the project substation or underground utility road crossings may require temporary closure or partial closure of roadways around the project site. An approved Traffic Control Plan has been prepared and will be implemented during construction of the project.\",\n",

Existing roads and access along the transmission line would be used to install the OPGW, and PG&E would use the same methods when maintaining the electrical system. The locations of the pull/reel sites have been identified through a combination of helicopter and ground surveys and a review of aerial imagery. The criteria used in selecting the final pull/reel sites were accessibility for vehicles, presence of flat or nearly flat land next to existing transmission line route for equipment set-up, existing land use, absence of or minimal habitat for sensitive species, and absence of resources that would restrict work. Preparation of the temporary pull/splice sites would require some minor ground disturbance. Minor structural modifications would also be made to each of the transmission towers to allow splice boxes to be mounted where the sections of OPGW would be spliced (every three to five miles). The pull/reel sites and transmission towers would be accessed generally along existing unimproved roads or improved unsurfaced or surfaced roads that lead to many of the towers; no new roads would be constructed. Helicopters would be used to place materials at the point of installation for towers inaccessible by road. At each of the 75 existing towers along the 17-mile 230 kV transmission line route, minor upgrades to the steel attachments would be required to accommodate installation of the OPGW. These upgrades would include only overhead work on the existing tower, such as replacing the gode peaks with a pulley to accommodate the OPGW. The existing static wire would then be used to pull the new OPGW through each tower pulley. Existing roads or helicopters would be used to provide access to the sites to fashion the attachments needed on each tower. Construction would be completed using a combination of helicopter and ground crews. Helicopters would be used to transport electrical workers to the towers, to deliver materials, and to assist in pulling the OPGW from tower to tower. Approximately four 150-foot by 100-foot landing zones would be constructed approximately every five miles using means similar to pull sites. Establishing these landing zones would involve minimal temporary ground disturbance, and the zones would facilitate the use of helicopters and reduce overall impacts associated with the work. Landing zones would primarily be used for staging materials, picking up and transporting electrical personnel and equipment, and refueling helicopters.\",\n",

The site is an active commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operated by Chemical Waste Management, Inc., and owned by Waste Management, Inc. Approximately 500 acres of the site have been approved for hazardous waste activity and are degraded; portions of the site are undeveloped. The site is used as a disposal site, and the hazardous waste facility operator (EPA Identification Number CAT000646117) applied for a permit modification in October 2013 (CDTSC 2013). The California Department of Toxic Substances Control approved this permit modification on June 23, 2014, which allowed the site to expand its landfilling activities. This effectively eliminated any potential to buy or lease the property for the construction of a PV solar facility. The site does not contain lands within the 100-year floodplain, though it does contain ephemeral drainages in the areas of greater slope. The site may contain wetlands (USFWS 2014), potential waters of the state, though no jurisdictional delineations have been performed. The San Joaquin kit fox and blunt-nosed leopard lizard, both of which are federal listed species, have been known to occur on portions of the site. Developing the site would require significant grading because many of the slopes are greater than 5 3 percent. The area of suitable slope would not provide the acreage needed to accommodate 247 MW of solar power output. This alternative was eliminated from detailed consideration in the EIS because it was of insufficient size to support a 247 MW PV generating facility and it is not available for sale or for long-term lease. Moreover, it is a brownfield site and development would likely disturb potentially contaminated soils.\",\n",
