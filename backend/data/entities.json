      "abstract": "Panoche Valley Solar, LLC (the applicant) is proposing to construct the Panoche Valley Solar Facility, a 247 megawatt photovoltaic solar generating facility in eastern unincorporated San Benito County, California. The proposed project site contains ephemeral drainages that have been determined to be jurisdictional waters of the U.S. Construction of the proposed project requires a Department of the Army permit from the US Army Corps of Engineers to discharge fill material into these waters, in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The US Army Corps of Engineers, as the lead agency responsible for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, made a preliminary determination that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action that may result in significant impacts on the environment, and that the preparation of an environmental impact statement was required. The proposed facility would consist of a solar field of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules; an electrical collection system that converts generated power from direct current to alternating current and delivers it to a project substation; and a project substation that collects and converts the generated power from 34.5 to 230 kilovolts. The electricity would then be delivered, via a new on-site Pacific Gas and Electric Company switching station, to its existing Moss Landing-Panoche 230 kilovolt transmission line. Generated electricity would be sold to Southern California Edison under a long-term power purchase agreement."

      "abstract": "In the Federal Register on July 19, 2012 (Fed. Reg. Vol. 77, No. 139, p. 42488), the USACE initiated a 30-day scoping period for this EIS; this period was extended by nearly 20 days to end on September 7, 2012. The NOI was published in the Hollister Free Lance on July 31 and August 3, 2012. Also, it was mailed to federal, state, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals known to have an interest in the project. The NOI invited the public to provide information on environmental impacts that could occur as a result of the proposed project as proposed in 2012. Copies of these materials are in Appendix A of this EIS. Public scoping meetings were held on August 21, 2012, at the Panoche School in Paicines, California, and on August 22, 2012, at the Veterans Memorial Building in Hollister, California. The meetings began with an open house that served as an informal question and answer session, followed by a formal presentation and oral comments. Eleven people attended the scoping meeting in Paicines, and six entered comments into the public record; thirty people attended the scoping meeting in Hollister, and nine entered comments into the public record. A court reporter recorded the formal presentations and oral comments to accurately capture the information presented at the meetings. The scoping period ended on September 7, 2012. Twenty written comment letters were submitted by the following agencies, tribes, and organizations and by 12 individuals (in all, 21 individuals commented with either written or oral comments): US Environmental Protection Agency, Valentin Lopez, Amah Mutsun Tribal Band of Costanoan/Ohlone Indians, Luis Alejo, Assembly Member, 28th District, California Audubon Society, Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, Citizens Committee to Complete the Refuge, Sierra Club, Loma Prieta Chapter. The issues raised in the oral and written comments are presented in Table ES-3Table ES-2. Approximately a third of the comments focused on biological resource issues. The comments received during scoping were similar in substance and nature to those received during the USACE public noticing periods in 2010 and 2011."

Distributed solar generation was evaluated as an alternative in the EIR for the Panoche Valley Solar Project. The California Solar Initiative Program aims to install 3,000 MW of new distributed solar generation systems. The report indicates that 2,139 MW of distributed solar had been installed in California by the end of the first quarter of 2014."

The project aims to contribute to California's energy needs. Although conservation and energy demand reduction measures are important, this particular project focuses on solar energy to meet growing energy demands."
